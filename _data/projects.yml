  description: >
    The Electrum Ravencoin wallet is meant to be a light weight wallet for users who are unable or unwilling
    to run a full ravencoin core wallet as well as allow for hardware support for users. It runs on a "shared node" system
    where users can wrap an electrum server around a Ravencoin node which allows electrum clients to get information about
    their addresses.

- name: Atomic Swaps
  description: >
    Atomic swaps allow for on-chain trades between ravencoin and ravencoin assets, or between two different ravencoin
    assets. This provides all the needed functionality to make Buy, Sell, and Trade orders that others may execute at
    will. In addition, these partial orders can be specially signed such that they are easily shared and completable
    by another party, allowing for clean 2-step orders where that can be shared through any number of side-channels.
